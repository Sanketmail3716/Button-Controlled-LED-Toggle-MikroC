# Button-Controlled-LED-Toggle-MikroC
This MikroC project demonstrates a simple embedded system that toggles an LED on RB1 using a button connected to RB5. It detects the rising and falling edges of the button press to change the LED state and initializes PORTC with a fixed pattern (0xAA). Ideal for PIC microcontroller beginners exploring digital I/O and debouncing logic.
